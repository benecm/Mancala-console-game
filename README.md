# Mancala-console-game
It's a simple console game written in C#. This project is my second console game, it was an assigment for my college.
I used Visual Studio to develop this project, and the basic librarys of C#. In this project i learned about the basics of  objective orientated programming.
In the game you will get a 2x6 map and you can place points clockwise in the "baskets" as you reach 2 or 3 points in the other players basket it can be added to your points.
